Notice
--------
This module had been different from [this one](https://github.com/chiehmin/Xposed-NetworkSpeedIndicator).

I had modified this module for doing H2OS and Oxygen OS supporting, maybe AOSP could be supported, but not recommend.

注意
--------
这个模块已经与[原模块](https://github.com/chiehmin/Xposed-NetworkSpeedIndicator)不同。

我修改了原模块来支持一加的氢氧OS，理论上原生系列可使用，但不建议。

--------
 * Shows upload and download speeds
 * Works for both Mobile and Wi-Fi networks

Translating
-----------
I had deleted so many language support for making new features, I will accept translation pull request in some day, but not now.
